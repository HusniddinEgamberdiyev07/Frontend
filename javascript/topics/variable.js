// A variable is named storage for data

// To create a variable use let keyword then name

// let name;
let fruit;

// Put value using assignment operator "="

// name = value
fruit = "apple";
console.log(fruit);     // We can access value using variable name

// We can combine variable declaration and into one single line.

let user = "Husniddin";



// Constants
// To declare a constant (you cannot change it) variable use const keyword instead of let.

const PI = 3.14     // You can't change the value.
console.log(PI);



// var 
// It is an old-school declaration. You don't use it.



// Variable naminrg:

// Variable name must contain only letters, numbers or symbols $ and _
// The first character must not be number.
// You can't use names which are used by language itself like let.
